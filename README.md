# Fuzzy Calendar

Do you find yourself trying to organise meet-ups and events with friends
but it's hard trying to pin down a date when everyone is free?

If so, then what you need is a **Fuzzy Calendar**!

Fuzzy Calendar is a web app that allows you to invite friends to events.
Instead of picking a set date for the event, you pick a start and end date,
and everyone fills in the dates that they could commit to.

Once everyone's votes are taken, Fuzzy Calendar cross-references everyone's
submissions to show you the best date for your event.
