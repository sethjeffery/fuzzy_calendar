Hi there, <%= @creator.name %>.

It's my pleasure to let you know that <%= @sender.name %> has RSVP'd to your event, <%= @event.name %>.

<% if @times.blank? %>Sadly, they are not available for any of the dates.<% else %>Here are the dates they picked:

<% @times.each do |time| %>- <%= specificity_long_format(@event.specificity, time.time) %><%= ' *' if time.favorite %>
<% end %>
<% end %>

For more information, you can view your event here:
